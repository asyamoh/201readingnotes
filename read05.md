# Images :
Choosing Images for our site ;
Images should:
* Be relevant
* Convey information
* Convey the right mood
* Be instantly recognisable
* Fit the color palette.

# Storing Images on site :
note : If you are building a site from scratch, it is good
practice to create a folder for all of the images
the site uses.

# Adding Images:
To add an image into the page
you need to use an < img>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
src
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site. (Here you can see that
the images are in a child folder
called images â€” relative URLs
were covered on pages 83-84).
alt
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.
title
You can also use the title
attribute with the < img> element
to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers
will display the content of this
attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.

## Three Rules for creating images :
* Save images in
the right format
Websites mainly use images in
jpeg, gif, or png format. If you
choose the wrong image
format then your image might
not look as sharp as it should
and can make the web page
slower to load.
* Save images at
the right size
You should save the image at
the same width and height it will
appear on the website. If
the image is smaller than the
width or height that you have
specified, the image can be
distorted and stretched. If the
image is larger than the width
and height if you have specified,
the image will take longer to
display on the page. 
* Use the correct
resolution
Computer screens are made up
of dots known as pixels. Images
used on the web are also made
up of tiny dots. Resolution refers
to the number of dots per inch,
and most computer screens only
show web pages at 72 pixels
per inch. So saving images at
a higher resolution results in
images that are larger than
necessary and take longer to
download.

## Summary
COLOR
* Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.


## TEXT
* There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.
* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
* You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
