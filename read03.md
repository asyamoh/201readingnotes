## Lists

Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

< ol >
The ordered list is created with
the < ol > element.
< li >
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening < li > tag
and a closing < /li > tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
Browsers indent lists by default.
Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the < ol> 
element to specify the type of
numbering (numbers, letters,
roman numerals and so on). It
is better to use the CSS liststyle-type property covered
on pages 333-335.

## Summary lists
* There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.

# Boxes
Box Dimensions
width, height

 ** By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.
The most popular ways to
specify the size of a box are
to use pixels, percentages, or
ems. Traditionally, pixels have
been the most popular method
because they allow designers to
accurately control their size.
When you use percentages,
the size of the box is relative to
the size of the browser window
or, if the box is encased within
another box, it is a percentage of
the size of the containing box.
When you use ems, the size
of the box is based on the size
of text within it. Designers
have recently started to use
percentages and ems more for
measurements as they try to
create designs that are flexible
across devices which have
different-sized screens.
In the example on the right, you
can see that a containing <div>
element is used which is 300
pixels wide by 300 pixels high.
Inside of this is a paragraph
that is 75% of the width and
height of the containing element.
This means that the size of the
paragraph is 225 pixels wide by
225 pixels high.**
