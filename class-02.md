## When creating a web page:
 you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.In this chapter we focus on how to add markup to the text that appears on your pages. You will learn about:Structural markup:● the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphsSemantic markup:● which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

 ## Headings 
 *HTML has six "levels" of headings:<h1> is used for main headings<h2> is used for subheadingsIf there are further sections under the subheadings then the <h3> element is used, and so on...Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an <h1> element is the largest, and the contents of an <h6> element is the smallest. The exact size at which each browser shows the headings can vary slightly. Users can also adjust the size of text in their browser. You will see how to control the size of text, its color, and the fonts used when we come to look at CSS.*

 # Visual editos & their code Views

 Content management systems and HTML editors such as Dreamweaver usually have two views of the page you are creating: a visual editor and a code view


 HTML elements are used to describe the structure of Xthe page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).They also provide semantic information (e.g. where Xemphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).
