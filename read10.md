i read about debugging and error handling: 

JavaScript can be hard to learn and everyone makes
mistakes when writing it. This chapter will help you learn
how to find the errors in your code. It will also teach you how
to write scripts that deal with potential errors gracefully.
When you are writing JavaScript, do not expect to write it perfectly the first time.
Programming is like problem solving: you are given a puzzle and not only do you have to solve
it, but you also need to create the instructions that allow the computer to solve it. too.



If you understand execution contexts (which have two
stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error
in your code.
Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a
process of deduction.
The console helps narrow down the area in which the
error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates
its own error object, which can tell you its line number
and gives a description of the error.
If you know that you may get an error, you can handle
it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
